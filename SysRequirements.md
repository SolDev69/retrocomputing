# True System Requirements for modern titles
This is the oldest hardware/software I would recommend playing these titles on.
Note: this doesn't apply for low end GPUs released in the 2010s such as the GeForce 210.

## Minecraft 
- A dual core processor
- 512MB (beta and older only), 1GB memory (1.5.2 and older) 4GB (1.6.4+)
- GeForce FX 5200 GPU or equivalent // latest Voodoo gpu you can get. (Any integrated graphics older than Haswell is a bad idea even for just Windows)
- Windows 98 (with KernelEx if you care about running anything newer than 1.5) // Windows NT 3.51 if your insane enough to get that working yourself.
- Wifi connection is highly recommended for first run.
- Java 5 (if you can get any alpha/beta version of MC running on Java 1.4 I salute you, let me know so I can update this)
